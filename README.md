# 🧬 Health Science Co-Authorship Network Analysis (UEF)

This project explores the internal structure of the Health Science faculty at the University of Eastern Finland through social network analysis. I extracted, cleaned, and visualized a co-authorship subgraph from the full UEF collaboration network.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Filtered the academic network to focus on the School of Medicine
- Cleaned and pruned the graph manually for clarity and coherence
- Analyzed key centrality metrics:
  - PageRank
  - Betweenness
  - Authority
  - Harmonic Closeness
  - Bridging Centrality
- Explored modularity and detected 13 well-defined communities
- Interpreted node roles: visible influencers vs. quiet connectors

## 📊 Key Findings

- Ritva Vanninen stood out as a central figure by PageRank
- Heikki Kröger acted as a major bridge between research clusters
- Sohvi Koponen, while not highly ranked in visibility, had strategic positioning as a silent connector
- The network is dense and well-connected with a clustering coefficient of 0.606

## 📎 Included File

- `HealthScience_SNA_Report.pdf`: full report including metrics, visualizations, interpretations, and insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Gephi (layout: Fruchterman-Reingold)
- Manual cleaning + interpretation
- Report written in academic English

## 🎓 Context

Developed during my Erasmus at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF) as part of the Social Network Analysis course. It demonstrates my ability to combine data cleaning, graph analysis, and technical storytelling.
