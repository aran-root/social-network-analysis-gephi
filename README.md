# 🧠 Social Network Analysis with Gephi

This project explores three well-known networks through the lens of centrality and graph theory using Gephi. The analyzed datasets are:

- 🥋 Zachary’s Karate Club
- 🐬 Dolphins social network
- 📖 Les Misérables character network

## 📈 What I Did

- Calculated key centrality metrics:
  - Degree Centrality
  - Betweenness Centrality
  - Closeness Centrality
  - Eigenvector Centrality
- Visualized and interpreted node importance and structural insights
- Compared and contrasted the three networks
- Produced a detailed report with tables and graphics

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Gephi
- Python (for pre-processing)
- Microsoft Word (for the report)

## 📄 Files Included

- `TASK1_FINAL_PROJECT.pdf`: Full report with metric analysis, network snapshots and key observations.

## 👨‍🎓 Context

This was part of my coursework at the University of Eastern Finland during my Erasmus exchange. It demonstrates both technical application and written communication of network analysis concepts.

## 🔜 More Coming Soon

Stay tuned for more data visualization and graph mining projects.
